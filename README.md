## Documentation for Liz Trull Portfolio 
This Graphic Design Portfolio is my first live site, coded from HTML & CSS used to present my work. Lots of time, effort, debugging, user testing, and help from google went into this work. 

This is the most in-depth project I've taken a part of to date; working closely with all of my portfolio pieces to make sure they fit into the vision of the site as a whole.

Languages Utilized: HTML & CSS.

Those who added critiques on my survey during user testing.

Many difficulties came with learning HTML & CSS, while coding a live site. Including:

-The sticky nav bar fell off my screen because I had a set height for the homepage container. 
-Mobile grid was an issue for me for a while, until I found the media query: '@media only screen and (max-width: 1100px)'
-Having links open to a new tab was a helpful critique I took and completed, with 'target_blank'.
-I am still having trouble with the vertical spacing of each subpage, especially for The Willow Project, where the images drop down lower than intended.
