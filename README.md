## Documentation for Liz Trull Portfolio 
This Graphic Design Portfolio is my first live site, coded from HTML & CSS used to present my work. Lots of time, effort, debugging, user testing, and help from google went into this work. 

This is the most in-depth project I've taken a part of to date; working closely with all of my portfolio pieces to make sure they fit into the vision of the site as a whole.

Languages Utilized: HTML & CSS.

**Many difficulties came with learning HTML & CSS, while coding a live site. Including:**

-The sticky nav bar fell off my screen because I had a set height for the homepage container. 

-Mobile grid was an issue for me for a while, until I found the media query: '@media only screen and (max-width: 1100px)'

-Having links open to a new tab was a helpful critique I took and completed, with 'target_blank'.

-I am still having trouble with the vertical spacing of each subpage, especially for The Willow Project, where the images drop down lower than intended.

Those who added critiques on my survey during user testing.


**Some survey feedback that was given during user testing included:**

-"Some of your links–like the one for your resume and for this survey–should open in a separate tab."

-"On the better day page, the pattern in the background on the site and in the background of your mock-ups clash, and friends out the cute little pill print- maybe you could put it all in a container of white or something solid?"

-"Find a more colorful photo for your headshot! You have all these beautiful colors on the site, but the black and white doesn’t fit in."

-"Maybe add a little more to your personal description it feels a little bare and doesn't stand out much. Also add a description to the Candle project because the rest of them have a description when you click on them but that one doesn't."
